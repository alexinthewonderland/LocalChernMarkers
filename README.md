# LocalChernMarkers
This page is currently is still on progress sorry! It is mainly a repository of my work done on calculating the Local Chern Marker (LCM) which is done under the supervision of Prof. Ady Stern from the Weizmann Institute of Science. 

In this repo, you will see a file (still also on progress) about what I learned and summary of this project. This note will be a continuously updated note, until the project is finished.
